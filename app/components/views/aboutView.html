<p>	About Highly Componentized Web Application</p>
<br>
<span class="label label-primary">Problem:</span>	When a simple web application becomes complicated and larger with hundreds or even thousand of components, team-working-in-parallel and communication among components become challenges. As business coverage group, components come and go more frequently. Developers need to spend a lot of time to modify dependency. 
<br><br>
<span class="label label-success">Solution:</span> One of solution to this problem is to make the components highly isolated.
<br><br>
I will describe how I achieved building a highly isolated-componentized application in one of my Oracle projects.
<br><br>
I used the pattern of publish/subscribe as my major communication method. My application was a container containing a series of isolated components/services. Each component/service only input data by
subscribing "topics" and only output data by publishing "topics". In this way, no component nor service has any knowledge about others (components and services). They only deal with a single party, the CommunicationManager which provides publishing and subscribing.
<br><br>
I put together a small demo to explain how it was done in my Oracle project. This small demo was written in AngularJS.
